            Using our advanced model, you can predict hectograms per hectare based on factors like:
            - 🌡️ Average Temperature
            - 🌧️ Pesticide Usage
            - 🌍 Country
            - 💧 Average Rainfall
            - ... and more!

            We employed the **Random Forest Regressor** to make these predictions, achieving impressive metrics:
            - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 121,234,416.31
            - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 11,010.65

            - **🌍 Area (Country):** This column contains categorical data representing different countries or regions. It is an object type and **has no missing values**.
            - **🌾 Item (Agricultural Product):** This column lists the type of agricultural product. It is also stored as an object. The data here indicates what crop or item is being analyzed.
            - **📅 Year:** An integer column indicating the year for which the data is recorded. It covers a range of years and tracks the changes over time.
            - **📈 hg/ha_yield (Crop Yield):** Contains integer data representing crop yield in hectograms per hectare (**hg/ha**). This is a key performance indicator of agricultural productivity.
            - **🌧️ average_rain_fall_mm_per_year (Average Rainfall):** A float column measuring the average annual rainfall in millimeters for each country. Rainfall is a crucial factor affecting crop yields.
            - **🧪 pesticides_tonnes (Pesticides Used):** A float column representing the amount of pesticides used, measured in tonnes. The use of pesticides can impact crop yield, but excessive use may have environmental and health repercussions.
            - **🌡️ avg_temp (Average Temperature):** This column contains float data representing the average temperature in degrees Celsius for each country during the respective year. Temperature is another significant factor that influences agricultural productivity.
